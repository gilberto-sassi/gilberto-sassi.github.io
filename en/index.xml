      <description>This function computes the power and sample size for basic testing hypothesis listed below.
One population and variable  Z test for mean (bilateral and unilateral): pwr_z_test_1pop t-test for mean (bilateral and unilateral): pwr_t_test_1pop Chi-squared for variance (bilateral and unilateral): pwr_sigma_1pop Proportion for test: pwr_prop_1pop  Two populations and variables  Z test for difference of means (bilateral and unilateral) with known variance: pwr_z_test_2pop F test to compare variance of two normal population: pwr_sigma_2pop t test for difference of means (bilateral and unilateral) with unknown variance and differences: pwr_t_test_2pop_hetero t test for difference of means (bilateral and unilateral) with unknown and equals: pwr_t_test_2pop_homo Paired t test: pwr_paired_t_test Test for proportions (bilateral and unilateral) in samples with more than 40 observations: pwr_prop_2pop  Checking association  Chi-sqaured to check association between two qualitative variables: pwr_chisq_test_association (implementation of power of test and sample size) Test for Pearson&amp;rsquo;s correlation using Fisher&amp;rsquo;s Z tranformation: z_fisher_test (implementation of test) and pwr_z_fisher_test (implementation of power of test and sample size)  Anova  Unbalanced ANOVA: pwr_anova_balanced (power of test and sample size) Balanced ANOVA: pwr_anova_unbalanced (only power of test)  Installation To install this package in R, it can be used the R package devtools:</description>

      <title>GeoFourierFDA: R package for Kriging Methods to Function-valued Data</title>

      <description>In this package, we have observed n curves χs1(t), ⋯, χsn(t) at locations s1, ⋯, sn in a specified region, where si = (θi, ηi), *i* = 1, …, n, θi is the latitute and ηi is the longitude. The aim is to estimate the unobserved curve χs0(t) where s0 ∉ {s1, ⋯sn}. The ideia proposed by Giraldo, Delicado, and Mateu (2011) was uncomplicated: the curve χs0(t) at s0 ∉ {s1, ⋯sn} is a linear combination of all the curves χs1(t), ⋯, χsn(t), i.</description>

      <description>This is a introductory course where we introductory statistics and an introduction to R programming are presented. All slides are in portuguese, but I think it is possible to understand it through the R code. All the data used in this course are from R packages and/or available in the web.

      <description>Hi!
I am Gilberto and work as an assistant professor at Federal University of Bahia, located at the sunny capital city of Bahia (a Brazilian&amp;rsquo;s northeast state) &amp;ndash; Salvador.
This is my personal website. I has used it to deliver slides, class notes and suplementar material to my students, and sometimes I post some R code and something that catch my attention at Research&amp;rsquo;s tab.
I like books and movies of scientific fiction, and I have supported and helped to build a better society where all contradictions of capitalism were overcame and all human begins are free and completely emancipated.</description>
